Introduction to Istio Ingress
Istio, an open-source service mesh widely embraced for overseeing and safeguarding communication within services and at the edge, relies on the Envoy proxy for its data plane. 
This proxy is adept at managing service-to-service communication, supporting both L3/L4 and L7 layers. Notably, the same proxy is employed for Istio Ingress.
When it comes to handling and securing traffic in cloud-native applications, Istio Ingress (or Istio Ingress Gateway) and Istio Gateway can seamlessly function at both L4 and L7 layers.
